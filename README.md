# twitchbot
So this was suppossed to auto-ban wipztv whenever he enters a chat room, but it seems to be banning him whenever anyone enters chat including other bots, nightbot, moobot, etc. 

Another feature I would like to add is the bot declaring whenever wipz is banned, but I'm pretty sure I can make that happen pretty easily once my other issue is solved
